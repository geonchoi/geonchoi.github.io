# Error Probability Analysis in SCL Decoding

[← Back to Research](/research/)

## Overview

Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding of polar codes is susceptible to two fundamental types of errors that significantly impact performance, especially in short packet transmission scenarios. Understanding these error mechanisms is crucial for developing advanced polar code variants and optimization strategies.

## Error Types in SCL Decoding

### Type I Error: Correct Codeword Elimination

**Definition**: The correct codeword path is eliminated from the candidate list during the decoding process before reaching the final decision stage.

![Type I Error Mechanism](../../assets/images/research/type1_error_mechanism.png)
*Figure 2: Mechanism of correct codeword elimination in SCL decoding tree*

**Characteristics**:
- Occurs early in the decoding process
- Caused by accumulated path metric errors
- Probability increases with lower list sizes
- More prominent in short blocklength scenarios

**Mathematical Analysis**:

The probability of Type I error can be bounded as:

$$P_{I} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{N} P(\text{elimination at stage } i | \text{correct path exists})$$

Where the stage-wise elimination probability depends on:
- Current path metrics of all candidates
- Reliability of the current bit position
- Accumulated noise effects

### Type II Error: Incorrect Codeword Selection

**Definition**: An incorrect codeword is selected as the final decision from the surviving candidate list.

![Type II Error Mechanism](../../assets/images/research/type2_error_mechanism.png)
*Figure 3: Incorrect codeword selection mechanism at the final decision stage*

**Characteristics**:
- Occurs at the final decision stage
- Related to insufficient minimum distance
- Dominates performance at high SNR
- Influenced by weight distribution properties

**Mathematical Analysis**:

The probability of Type II error is related to the pairwise error probability:

$$P_{II} \leq \sum_{\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{c}_0} P(\mathbf{c} \text{ selected} | \mathbf{c}_0 \text{ transmitted})$$

This can be bounded using the union bound and minimum distance properties.

## Theoretical Framework

### Joint Error Probability Analysis

The overall error probability of SCL decoding can be expressed as:

$$P_e = P_I + P_{II|I^c}$$

Where:
- $P_I$: Probability of Type I error
- $P_{II|I^c}$: Probability of Type II error given no Type I error occurred

### Channel Reliability Impact

The error probabilities are strongly influenced by channel reliability patterns:

*Figure 4: Impact of channel reliability on different error types*

**Type I Error Sensitivity**:
- Highly sensitive to early unreliable channels
- Exponential degradation with poor frozen bit selection
- Mitigation through improved polarization

**Type II Error Sensitivity**:
- Depends on overall minimum distance
- Related to weight distribution properties
- Addressed through outer code concatenation

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Information-Theoretic Bounds

Using information theory, tighter bounds can be derived:

**Gallager's Random Coding Bound**:
$$P_e \geq E_0(\rho, R)$$

**Sphere Packing Bound**:
$$P_e \geq \text{Vol}(\mathcal{S}) \cdot P(\text{error in sphere})$$

### Finite-Length Scaling Laws

For finite blocklengths, the error probability scaling follows:

$$P_e \approx Q\left(\sqrt{N} \cdot \frac{C - R}{\sigma}\right) + o(N^{-1/2})$$

Where the dispersion parameter $\sigma$ captures finite-length effects.

### Complexity-Performance Trade-offs

- Blocklengths: N = 128, 256, 512, 1024
- Code rates: R = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3
- List sizes: L = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
- Channel models: AWGN, Rayleigh fading

### Results and Analysis

**Key Findings**:
1. **Low SNR Region**: Type I errors dominate
2. **Medium SNR Region**: Transition between error types
3. **High SNR Region**: Type II errors become prominent
4. **Short Blocklengths**: Both error types equally critical

## Applications and Impact
