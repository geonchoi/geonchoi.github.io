## Theoretical Foundation


### Polar Codes and Advanced Coding Techniques

#### Polar Code Overview

Polar codes, discovered by Arıkan in 2009, are the first provably capacity-achieving codes with explicit construction. They exploit the channel polarization phenomenon to achieve capacity with low encoding/decoding complexity of O(N log N). However, finite-length performance and specific error patterns in successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding present challenges for URLLC applications.

![Polar Code Construction](../assets/images/research/polarization.png)
*Figure 1: Polar code construction and channel polarization phenomenon*

Polar codes face two fundamental challenges in practical deployment: **decoding errors** (Type I: path elimination, Type II: incorrect selection) and **blocklength constraints** (natural construction for N = 2^n only). My research develops targeted solutions addressing these specific limitations.

### Channel Polarization Phenomenon

Polar codes exploit the remarkable channel polarization phenomenon discovered by Arıkan in 2009. Through recursive channel combining and splitting operations, a set of N synthetic channels becomes either nearly perfect or nearly useless:

$$W_N^{(i)}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}^N \times \mathcal{X}^{i-1}$$

![Channel Polarization](../../assets/images/research/polarization.png)
*Figure 2: Channel polarization phenomenon showing bit-channel capacities*

**Key Properties**:
- **Capacity Achievement**: Polar codes achieve the symmetric capacity I(W) of the underlying channel
- **Explicit Construction**: No random codes needed - completely deterministic construction
- **Low Complexity**: Encoding and decoding complexity of O(N log N)
- **Recursive Structure**: Natural binary tree structure enabling efficient processing

### Successive Cancellation (SC) Decoding

The basic SC decoder processes bits sequentially, making hard decisions at each step:

$$\hat{u}_i = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i \in \mathcal{F} \\
\arg\max_{u_i} W_N^{(i)}(y_1^N, \hat{u}_1^{i-1} | u_i) & \text{if } i \in \mathcal{I}
\end{cases}$$

Where $\mathcal{F}$ is the frozen set and $\mathcal{I}$ is the information set.



## Practical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 3: Error Event Analysis and Mitigation

Understanding and addressing specific error mechanisms in SCL decoding is crucial for optimal performance.

#### Fundamental Error Types

![Error Analysis Framework](../../assets/images/research/error_comprehensive.png)
*Figure 6: Comprehensive error analysis framework for SCL decoding*

**Type I Error - Path Elimination**:
- Correct path eliminated from candidate list
- Dominates at low-to-medium SNR
- Addressed by SPP codes and increased list sizes

**Type II Error - Incorrect Selection**:
- Wrong path selected from remaining candidates
- Dominates at high SNR due to minimum distance
- Addressed by deep polar codes and concatenation

### Challenge 1: Finite-Length Performance

While polar codes are asymptotically capacity-achieving, their finite-length performance, especially for short packets, requires enhancement through advanced techniques.

#### Deep Polar Codes: Multi-Layer Concatenation

**Problem Addressed**: Type II errors (incorrect codeword selection) in SCL decoding

![Deep Polar Architecture](../../assets/images/research/deep_polar_comprehensive.png)

- **Weight Distribution Enhancement**: Improved minimum distance properties
- **SCL Decoding Enhancement**: Effective increase in list size without proportional complexity

**Mathematical Framework**:
For L-layer deep polar codes:
$$\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{u}_L \mathbf{G}_L \Pi_{L-1} \mathbf{G}_{L-1} \cdots \Pi_1 \mathbf{G}_1$$

**Performance Gains**:

## Performance Analysis and Validation

### Theoretical Bounds

**Finite-Length Scaling**:
$$P_e \approx Q\left(\sqrt{N} \frac{C - R}{V/N}\right) + O(N^{-3/2})$$

Where V is the channel dispersion parameter.

**Union Bound Analysis**:
For enhanced constructions:
$$P_e \leq \sum_{d=d_{min}}^{N} A_d Q\left(\sqrt{2d\gamma}\right)$$
