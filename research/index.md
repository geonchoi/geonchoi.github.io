# Research

My research interests span information theory, channel coding, and machine learning applications in wireless communications. I focus on developing novel coding schemes and optimization techniques for next-generation wireless systems.

## Current Research Areas

### Deep Learning-Enhanced Error Correction
- Development of deep polar codes for short blocklength transmission
- Machine learning approaches to channel coding optimization
- Neural network-based decoder architectures

### Polar Codes and Advanced Coding Techniques
- Sparsely pre-transformed polar codes for low-complexity decoding
- Rate-matching techniques for polar codes
- Two-stage decoding approaches for improved performance

### State Estimation and Signal Processing
- Split-KalmanNet for robust state estimation
- Machine learning-enhanced Kalman filtering
- Applications in vehicular communication systems

### Integrated Radar and Communication Systems
- Information-theoretic approaches to joint radar-communication design
- Pulse-Doppler radar integration with communication systems
- Spectrum sharing between radar and communication systems

## Research Philosophy

I believe in bridging theoretical foundations with practical implementations. My work aims to:

- Develop theoretically sound solutions with practical impact
- Leverage machine learning to enhance classical communication techniques
- Create efficient algorithms suitable for real-world deployment
- Foster collaboration between academia and industry

## Ongoing Projects

### Deep Polar Codes Extension
Developing rate-matching techniques for deep polar codes to enable flexible coding rates while maintaining excellent error correction performance.

### Non-Coherent Polar-Coded Communication
Investigating polar codes for block-fading channels without channel state information, using code-splitting techniques.

### Quantum-Enhanced Error Correction
Exploring the intersection of quantum computing and classical error correction for future wireless systems.
