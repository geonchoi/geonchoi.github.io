# Research

My research interests span information theory, channel coding, and machine learning applications in wireless communications. I focus on developing novel coding schemes and optimization techniques for next-generation wireless systems, with particular emphasis on short packet communications and URLLC scenarios.



<!-- ## Ongoing Projects

Developing next-generation polar codes for 6G applications with focus on ultra-low latency requirements (< 1ms), high reliability targets (10^-9 error rates), and energy-efficient implementations.

### Project 2: ML-Enhanced Channel Coding
**Duration**: 2025 - Present  
**Collaboration**: Industry Partner

Investigating neural network approaches for adaptive decoding algorithms, joint optimization with physical layer, and hardware acceleration strategies.

### Project 3: Semantic Communication Systems
**Duration**: 2025 - Present  
**Focus**: Task-oriented communication

Developing coding schemes that consider message semantic importance, end-to-end system optimization, and real-time adaptation capabilities. -->



## Current Research Areas


### Channel Coding

Channel coding is fundamental to reliable digital communication systems, providing error correction capabilities that enable robust data transmission over noisy channels. As wireless systems evolve towards 6G with stringent requirements for ultra-low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity, advanced channel coding techniques become increasingly critical.

My research focuses on two primary areas: **advanced polar coding for future wireless communication systems** and **deep learning-enhanced error correction**. These approaches address the evolving challenges of next-generation wireless networks, particularly in URLLC scenarios requiring error rates below $10^{-9}$ with sub-millisecond latency constraints.

### Deep Learning-Enhanced Error Correction

Modern communication systems increasingly benefit from machine learning approaches to channel coding. My research focuses on neural network-based decoders that can learn optimal decision boundaries and adapt to channel conditions, particularly for non-binary codes and high-order modulation schemes.

We focus on error correction code transformer (ECCT) optimized for high-order modulation, non-binary code extensions.

<!-- ### Semantic Communication and Unequal Error Protection

Modern communication systems require awareness of semantic importance in transmitted data. Different parts of a message vector carry varying significance depending on the application task, necessitating adaptive protection schemes.

My research develops coding schemes that dynamically adjust protection levels based on semantic importance, enabling task-oriented optimization and improved end-to-end performance.

<!-- ### Signal Processing and State Estimation

Robust state estimation is crucial for dynamic wireless environments, particularly in vehicular communications and IoT scenarios. My research develops ML-enhanced filtering techniques that outperform traditional approaches under non-linear and uncertain conditions.

<!-- ### Integrated Radar and Communication Systems

Spectrum-efficient solutions that serve both radar sensing and communication functions are essential for future wireless systems. My research establishes information-theoretic foundations for joint system design and develops practical waveform optimization techniques.
